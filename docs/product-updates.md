Our engineers are hard at work daily to make Workato better! View the latest updates to our platform below.

## API Platform update
##### March 2020

### Custom Domain Names for simpler and intuitive API URLs
By setting up custom domain names for REST APIs, you can provide better customer experience with user-friendly names, develop consistency in branding, and improve security.

The base URL format for invoking APIs you deploy uses the default hostname apim.workato.com.
```
https://apim.workato.com/
```
With custom domain names, you can use an alternative domain to set up your API’s hostname. 
``` 
https://www.acme.com/ 
```
In order to set up a custom domain for your APIs, you must have a registered internet domain name. Additionally, you will be required to provide a certificate for a custom domain name. 
Typically, the steps to register a custom domain and obtain certificates take a long time and often require special developer resources. 

Workato makes it straightforward to set up and use a custom domain name by enabling you to register for a domain name and providing the required certificates. For increased security, Workato automatically updates these certificates on your behalf periodically to reduce the attack surface area.

*Now you can register a custom domain to personalize your API*

## Workbot for Microsoft Teams
##### March 2020

### Making Workbot for Microsoft Teams secure and personalized
Workato’s Workbot for Microsoft Teams is a multi-purpose and powerful tool that you can use to execute tasks from MS Teams that perform actions like updating opportunities in Salesforce, approving expenses in Concur, and assigning tickets in ServiceNow, just to name a few. Now, by turning on personal connections, you can have Workbot authenticate user credentials and only let authorized users complete the requested actions (e.g. approving expense, updating ticket status, etc.). 

By allowing only authorized users to have access to viewing or modifying information in a business process or application, you improve security and also make the experience more personalized (e.g. listing only opportunities that an Account Executive cares about).

![Workbot Personal Connections](~@img/workbot-personal-connections.png)
*Turning on Personal Connections ensures the person using Workbot for MS Teams has the right credentials*

## PGP Connector Update
##### March 2020

### More options when encrypting and decrypting with the PGP connector
Workato’s Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) connector is used by companies to meet common security requirements to ensure privacy (encryption) and authentication (digital signature). This added layer of security above and beyond network level security meets the needs of companies integrating with partners, like banks, who often need to transfer files with sensitive information.

We enhanced existing encrypt and decrypt actions as well as added standalone actions for signing and verifying. This includes:
- Encrypt action with optional signing
- Decrypt action with optional verification
- New Sign action for digitally signing the data
- New Verify action to authenticate signed content

![PGP Connector Actions](~@img/pgp-connector-new-actions.png)
*The PGP Connector got a few additional actions that provide more flexibility when encrypting and decrypting files*

**Links:**
- [Documentation](/features/pgp-encryption.md)

## UI update
##### Feb 2020

### Recipe Editor design updates
We are constantly making updates to the user interface to increase user productivity and make Workato even easier to use. Below are a few updates you may have noticed recently.

The "What happens next?" action in our recipe editor is horizontal instead of vertical to make it easier to see the options while preserving visibility to the rest of the recipe.

![Horizontal Action Bar](~@img/horizontal_action_bar.png)
*The 'What happens next?' options are displayed horizontally*

We have also improved the color and styling on the event tags (New, Bulk, Batch, Deprecated, and Real Time), and additional source information will now be shown when hovering over Data Pills.

## Connector update
##### Feb 2020

### Google Drive update
The new trigger - **New file or folder in folder hierarchy** - is a powerful addition to the Google Drive connector. It enables recipes to trigger jobs on a selected folder and any of its sub-folders. This trigger checks periodically for new files or folders created in a specified folder and its subfolders. Each new file and folder generates a new job.
This trigger is compatible with streaming, allowing it to send large amounts of data from Google Drive to other streaming compatible connectors in Workato.

This new trigger has many benefits, including:
- Reduces maintenance by eliminating the need to refresh the folder/sub-folder data for the trigger
- Simplifies automated backup of folders and files in Google drive into any downstream file management software
- Prevents loss of data/files owing to new sub-folders and files created after the recipe start

**Links:**
- [Documentation](/connectors/google-drive/trigger-new-file-hierarchy.md)

## Connector update
##### Feb 2020

### Salesforce bulk upsert action update
We previously only allowed External ID as a valid field for Primary Key in the Salesforce bulk upsert action. We now accept all indexed fields (Salesforce record ID, Name, any custom indexed field) as well.

**Use cases**
For customers that do not store an ID in their external systems and use the Salesforce record ID (or other internal fields) as the primary identifier of a record, they can now use that field as the Primary Key by toggling the field to text and entering the name of the field.

**Links:**
- [Documentation](/connectors/salesforce/salesforce-bulk.md#salesforce-object-to-create-update-upsert)

## Platform update
##### Feb 2020

### Tracking billable recipes
We announced some radical changes to simplify pricing for customers last year and a lot of you have taken advantage of the new recipe-based pricing model. To help you plan and optimize usage, we have added a new section in your Workspace to view all purchased add-ons and recipe packages. Additionally, you can also track current and historical recipe usage trends.

Legacy usage-based plans will be supported through this release in the following way: Plans that have a billable metric, like tasks, will have a thermometer representation in the UI to show the consumption of tasks. Usage-based plans with no billable metrics will just show the plan name and feature add-ons.

**Subscription Page (under account settings):**
![Recipe Pricing Subscription Screen](~@img/recipe_pricing_subscription_screen.png)
*Plan information, usage stats, and tasks are now displayed on the user subscription page*

## Platform update
##### Feb 2020

### Trash smartfolder
Teams of developers working together who may accidentally delete a recipe will now have a safety net of 30 days to recover an item that was deleted. This will help our customers solve the often costly problem of a mistakenly deleted item.

Users will only be able to see items in the Trash folder to which they have access. The customer's admin will have access to all items and will serve as the point of contact for help in recovering accidentally deleted items.

- Customers can view items that were deleted and restore items within 30 days of deletion
- Customers have the option to permanently delete items from the Trash folder
- Restore recipes that have been accidentally deleted

## Connector update
##### Feb 2020

### NetSuite SuiteTalk 2019_2 API
We recently migrated our NetSuite connector to the SuiteTalk 2019_2 API. NetSuite has 2 major releases of their API every year which includes updates to their WSDL. With this update, the NetSuite connector now has access to more record types and field types which may not have been found previously.

**Links:**
- [View added record types](https://docs.workato.com/connectors/netsuite.html#suitetalk-2019-2-changes)

## Connector update
##### Feb 2020

### Data replication in Snowflake
Let Workato replicate your data into Snowflake without data warehouse maintenance or DevOps. Maintain table definition from data source automatically and utilize built-in data deduplication.

When new/updated data is detected from the data source, Workato first inspects the new object definition against the existing Snowflake table schema. Any mismatches will be reconciled by updating the table definition in Snowflake. Following that, the data is then deduplicated and inserted/updated in the Snowflake table.

This action performs data loading in batches. It is able to handle batch sizes of up to 16,384 rows (Snowflake limitation).

For the schema replication as intended, the data source (application) must able to pick up new fields when an object definition changes. Additionally, the object structure should not be too complex (highly nested, nested arrays) for optimal results.

**Links:**
- [View data replication action documentation](https://docs.workato.com/connectors/snowflake/replicate.html)

## Connector update
##### Jan 2020

### Enhanced hierarchical relationship management in Salesforce
An object relationship in Salesforce is a two-way association between two objects. Relationships are created by creating custom relationship fields on an object. This is done so that when users view records, they can also see and access related data from related objects.

We have updated the Salesforce connector to allow access to relationships beyond the parent. Toggle the related objects field in triggers and actions to accept text input. This will allow you to enter multiple object relationships. Learn more in the link below.

**Links:**
- [Related objects in Salesforce](https://docs.workato.com/connectors/salesforce/related-objects.html#grandparent-relationships)

## Platform update
##### Dec 2019

### Dependency Graph
As the number of your automations and the size of teams building automations increase, there’s also a dramatic increase in the interdependency between assets e.g. callable recipes, connections, common data models, lookup tables etc.

Workato’s Dependency Graph visually illustrates the relationships between every asset and resource in a Workspace. Users can easily browse and inspect dependencies, and identify and assess how a change in one asset e.g. connection might impact other assets.

## Activity audit log
###### Oct 10, 2019

### Why this is important
Business systems group in a lot of enterprises consists of big teams developing and managing automations. As team size grows, it becomes important to track and audit changes made by the team members so that disruptions to business are minimized by unintended changes.

### What this means
Activity audit log provides quick and easy access to events, operations and actions done by users of Workato workspace. It is a critical tool for administrators to monitor changes done to the integrations. Activity audit log is available in the Dashboard > Audit  tab.

### Benefits
- Critical investigation tool in case of unauthorized or unintended operations
- Create activity audit document for compliance purposes
- Visibility and monitoring in a collaborative team environment
- Helps administrators answer questions such as -
  - Which user stopped the recipe? When?
  - When did user last login?
  - What actions a user has taken in last 7 days?
  - Who invited a collaborator?
  - When was my connection modified? By Who?

**Links:**
- [Documentation](/features/activity-audit-log.md)

## Job debug tracing
###### Oct 25, 2019

### Why this is important
Many a times recipes and actions in the recipe may run into an error requiring debugging. For example, if a customer gets `404 Not Found` when updating incident in ServiceNow as part of incident management automation. As the size and complexity of the project grows, so does the time consumed in debugging errors. Whether Workato is used by developers, integration specialists or citizen developers, it is critically important to make it easy to find and debug errors so developers can spend more time building automations.

### What we’ve done

- Most connectors make HTTP requests as part of each action (for example, actions like  Update Record or Search Record by the Salesforce connector)
- This feature traces HTTP request details for each action in the recipe
- Shows HTTP URL, headers, request and response for each HTTP request
- Available in the Debug tab of the action line when a job is rerun

### Benefits

- Increase developer velocity in building functional Workato recipes (because of faster identification, investigation, and resolution of issues)
- Respond to and solve production issues faster
- Shorten duration of  impact to user experience during production issues
- Reduce time and cost in troubleshooting issues

## Slack Block kit on Workato
###### Sept 25, 2019

### What is Block kit on Workbot
- Leverages [Slack Block Kit](https://api.slack.com/block-kit), Slack’s UI framework
- Allows more control and flexibility over the message layout and interactive elements
- Stack and re-order blocks

### What does this mean?
- Richer messages in post message / post command reply actions
- New date picker block
- New overflow menu block
- New divider block
- Ease of use - easier to add blocks, re-arrange by dragging & dropping
- Prototyping  - preview message from recipe in Slack’s block kit builder

Check out the new Block kit functionalities here:
- [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJSpPaT4opg&feature=youtu.be)
- [Documentation](/workbot/block-kit.md)

## On-prem groups
###### Sept 16, 2019

### Key Value Propositions:
- High Availability (HA) and Load Balancing
- Customer Experience
- Prevent Data and Revenue Loss

[On-prem groups](/on-prem/groups.md) help achieve zero downtime for recipes that involves on-prem connections and prevent data and revenue loss through missing SLAs. All critical workflows running on on-prem connections are kept running 100% of the time because recipe can process jobs successfully even when one of the user’s on-prem servers goes down.

### How it works:
- Users can add multiple agents to each group
- A connection uses an on-prem group to interact with on-prem apps instead of through a single agent
- Connection is live and recipe can process jobs successfully even when one of the user’s on-prem server goes down

## Robust data protection and compliance with flexible data retention
###### Sept 01, 2019

Securing customer data is a core value of our platform. With data protection standards, such as GDPR, and the sheer mass of data that companies collect and accumulate, the protection and control of information has become increasingly important.

### What is flexible data retention?
- Customers can customize their data retention period to fit their compliance policies
- Data retention periods can be set in hours or days
- The retention periods will vary by plan

### Why is this important?
Due to highly publicized instances of data breach, most enterprise customers are sensitive and insistent on protecting their data. With the flexible and lower data retention period support, data breach exposure is limited since Workato will destroy the data when data retention period ends.

### How do I change the data retention period?
Customer administrator or account owner of Business and above plans can navigate to `Account Settings` > `Data retention` to configure data retention. Specify number of hours or days and the data retention period unit.

## Recipe collections
###### Aug 16, 2019

Recipe Collections are a group of curated recipes that work together to solve a specific use case. Recipe Collections expect to bring customer centric view of the automations instead of a recipe centric view. We hope to improve discoverability of automation possibilities and better communicate the problems solved and value of recipes.

View the first release of recipe collections at: https://www.workato.com/recipes/browse.

## Connector SDK version control and release management
###### Aug 10, 2019

The latest updates to the [connector SDK](/developing-connectors/sdk/quick-Start.md) enable customers to manage versions of the connector, rollback or roll forward to a specific version, control which version of the connector is used in recipes, and sharing custom connectors across workspaces.

### Auto-versioning
Similar to recipe versioning, connector SDKs are automatically versioned when changes are made.

### Version rollback and roll forward
It is easy to view the history of changes made to the connector by browsing the versions. Users can deploy a specific version by simply choosing to revert to that version of the connector.

### Releasing a version
Users can now control which version of their custom connector is used in recipes by choosing to release a stable version of it. They can then continue building their custom connector without it affecting any active running recipes.

### Sharing a custom connector
Users can share a custom connector across workspaces using share links or our recipe lifecycle management feature. When new versions of a custom connector are released, cloned connectors get a notification to upgrade to the latest released version.

### Key benefits:
- Active safeguards against the unwanted syntax errors spoiling recipes. 
- Ability to release stable versions and continue development without implicating live recipes.
- Ability to roll back unwanted changes
- Greater control over custom connector management
- Enhanced developer experience 


## Connector update: Hubspot
###### Jul 20, 2019

Check out our [last update](#major-connector-update-hubspot) on Hubspot for more information on the latest major Hubspot connector enhancement.

#### HubSpot Companies API Support
Support has been added for the Company object in Hubspot with the following triggers/actions:

**Triggers:**
- New company
- New/updated company

**Actions:**
- Create company
- Update company
- Get company details by ID
- Search companies by domain name

#### HubSpot Additional OAuth Scopes
Support has been added for users to select multiple OAuth scopes when establishing a connection with our HubSpot connector. This will allow you to build custom actions for HubSpot APIs beyond the scope of Contacts, Deals, Engagements and Companies.


## Connector update: Wrike
###### Jul 17, 2019

#### Custom fields selector on triggers and actions
The custom field selector has been added to the Wrike connector's triggers and actions. This field selector is usually implemented on applications that usually have many customer-defined custom fields (eg. Salesforce, Quickbase).

The Fields list input field allows users to select the fields they wish to use in the recipe. This ensures that the recipe will be affected only by changes to these subset of fields, and therefore minimize impact on the recipe due to schema changes. Some benefits include:

- Improved recipe performance
- Improved recipe usability due to smaller datatree with only relevant datapills
- Minimizes impact on recipe by Salesforce object schema changes


## Connector update: Marketo
###### Jul 06, 2019

#### Marketo upsert leads in batches
The Marketo connector has been enhanced with a new action: Upsert lead (Batch). By utilizing bulk APIs to sync large amounts of data, fewer jobs are needed and fewer API calls to move the same amount of data. As a result, recipe run time often decreases.

The action accepts a list of 300 leads at maximum.


## Major connector update: Hubspot
###### Jun 30, 2019


#### Update details
The Hubspot connector has been updated to support [new triggers, actions and custom fields](https://www.workato.com/integrations/hubspot).

The new set of triggers and actions enables automation of marketing workflows for campaign management, email list generation, lead enrichment, lead tracking, customer onboarding, partner onboarding, and more. They enable Hubspot customers to build custom workflows, connect to on-prem apps/databases, and perform bulk operations e.g. syncing millions of contacts with Salesforce or Mailchimp.

## Platform security: Just-in-Time provisioning now supports custom roles
###### Jun 23, 2019

#### What is Just-in-time provisioning
Just-in-Time provisioning enables customers to use a SAML assertion to create users in downstream  apps e.g. Workato on-demand when users log into the app for the very first time.
This eliminates the need to manually provision user accounts in advance. For example, instead of manually creating a Workato account for a new employee customers can use Just-in-Time provisioning to dynamically create the Workato account when the new employee initially logs in using Single Sign On (SSO).

#### For Whom
- Available for all plans that include SSO & Teams
- All current accounts using Teams with SAML based SSO (e.g. OKTA, One Login or other)

#### Why we built it
- Supporting custom roles for Just-in-time provisioning allows customers to enforce custom security policies for Workato
- The standard roles Admin, Analyst, and operator available with Just-in-time provisioning  don't suffice for customer's security policies

#### How it works
- First, Workato admin creates a custom role e.g.mktg_ops for marketingOps that can only access, create, or modify objects (recipes, connections,OPA etc.) in the Marketing folder.
- Next, the authentication method is set to SAML based SSO (e.g. Okta, OneLogin) with SAML JIT enabled.
- The 3rd party identity provider (i.e. Okta, Onelogin) is configured to use the custom role value e.g. mktg_ops for the workato_role as one of the SAML attributes
- When a user logs into Workato using SAML based SSO for the first time, the identity provider (i.e. Okta,OneLogin) passes the custom role value e.g. mktg_ops for workato_role.
- The user's Workato account is then automatically provisioned with the custom role i.e. mktg_ops

#### Why it is useful
- *Reduced Administrative Costs:* Eliminates manual work to provision Workato accounts thus reducing cost of operations.
- *Increased Security:* In addition to the access/security policies enforced by the identity provider, customers can now enforce custom security policies for Workato accounts.
- *Faster Onboarding & improved employee experience:* New hires have faster access to Workato accounts with the right access privileges.

## Platform security: Two-factor authentication
###### Jun 12, 2019

#### What is Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)
Two-Factor Authentication is an extra layer of security used to make sure that people trying to gain access to an online account are who they say they are. First, a user will enter their username and a password. Then, instead of immediately gaining access, they will be required to provide another piece of information. This second factor could come from one of the following categories:

1. **Something you know:** This could be a personal identification number (PIN), a password, answers to “secret questions” or a specific keystroke pattern
2. **Something you have:** Typically, a user would have something in their possession, like a credit card, a smartphone, or a small hardware token
3. **Something you are:** This category is a little more advanced, and might include biometric pattern of a fingerprint, an iris scan, or a voice print

**Source**: https://authy.com/what-is-2fa/

#### For Whom
- Available for all plans
- All existing and new accounts

#### How it works
Workato's two-factor authentication uses a software generated time-based, one-time passcode (also called TOTP, or soft-token)
- First, a user must download and install a free 2FA app (e.g. Google Authenticator, Authy, or other) on their smartphone or desktop
- Next, they will need to go to their Account settings section to enable two-factor authentication.
- When enabled, the user will be prompted to go through a couple of simple steps to activate 2FA for their account

#### Why is it useful
- Customers can add a secondary layer of security to protect unauthorized and fraudulent access to their Workato account
- Similar to SSO, enterprise IT teams can now use 2FA to alleviate risks by enforcing security policies that require 2FA.
- Enables secure onboarding of collaborators to a team
- Eliminates the painful policy for periodic password reset

#### Resources
- [Documentation](/security/two-factor-authentication.md)

## Webhooks wizard
###### Jun 03, 2019

#### Background: Why webhooks?
Webhooks is part of a larger platform offering: custom connectivity. While we have a strong list of triggers out of the box, user data shows that 44% of our users require custom connectivity to some extent. It is typically used to connect to proprietary or legacy apps.

Users use need webhooks for time-sensitive use cases. These use cases require real-time triggering of workflows like requesting an outbound call to a lead downloading the company ebook.

#### For Whom
- Users looking to build recipes with real-time triggers
- Available to all plans

#### Why we built it
Webhooks has been a key part of many customer use cases. In the last year alone, Workato saw more than 2.5x increase in the number of recipes using webhook triggers to enable real-time automation. This trend is expected to continue increasing exponentially. We want to make the user experience for this popular trigger the best out there.

#### How it works
This wizard takes the user through a guided flow to test and verify a webhook trigger. We take the information from this test to configure the metadata automatically.

#### What problems does it solve for you
Unlike other products in the iPaaS space, building a webhooks trigger can now take less than 5 mins (down from 15-30 minutes). Often, users will need to switch back and forth between the recipe and their app.
Additionally, users need to learn/understand the webhooks metadata - what the webhook schema looks like, which HTTP method and data type to expect.
Lastly, it is difficult to verify that a webhook trigger is configured correctly. Users needed to do end-to-end tests with active recipes.

1. Simplify UX - users can verify if the webhook trigger works immediately.
2. Reduce skill barrier and human error - wizard detects key information  and uses it to configure the trigger automatically.

## API Platform with JWT authentication
###### May 12, 2019

#### For Whom
- Customers looking to expose internal business processes, and data to be accessed from portals, widgets in SaaS apps, and other internal service
- Customers looking to expose business processes, and data for external partners to consume
- Add-on for Business Plus and above plans

#### Why we built it
- Customers expect API management capabilities when purchasing iPaaS
- Digital businesses need APIs for agility to improve time-to-market, reduce cost of change, and solve a diverse set of use cases
- Increase the publishing and consumption of APIs by reducing the skill and cost barriers

#### How it works
API platform provides the following:

- *RESTful API Endpoints* - expose callable recipes as RESTFUL endpoints
- *API access control* - JWT and auth token based authentication; IP whitelisting
- *API Collections & Policies* - Purpose specific API groups; rate and usage metering for QoS
- *Dashboard & Activity* - Real-time monitoring of usage and health

#### Why is it useful
- *Create New Experiences* - Access to data & services through mobile apps, portals, widgets, bots, and other interfaces
- *Improve security and compliance* - Share data without direct access to underlying apps and systems
- *Increase reuse to reduce cost* - Create reusable components that can be shared to reduce dev costs

#### Competitive Advantages
- *Reduced skill barrier*  -  business analysts, App admins, and non-developer personas can publish & consume
- *Reduced costs* - lower development & maintenance costs; lower operations cost; zero DevOps
- *Faster time to value* - faster development cycles; rapid iterations for adapting to changing requirements
- *Rapid adoption at scale* - enables more roles in the enterprise to participate in the digital transformation

## Automation Dashboard And Job History Search
###### May 05, 2019

#### For Whom
- Customers looking to monitor mission and business critical automations
- Operators/Admins responsible for triaging/resolving issues quickly for SLA
- All plans

#### Challenges Addressed
- Elimination of manual steps to analyze and discover issues across all recipes in an account
- Lack of visibility into historical trends in jobs processed/failed to analyze health of all recipes in an account.
- Extremely time consuming manual process of reviewing log for each job run for auditing and triaging issues. Unsustainable for recipes with 100s of jobs.

#### How it works
Users have instant visibility into the health of recipes, connections, OPA, jobs from a single view- Automation Dashboard.

- Real-time visualization of data pertaining to recipes, connections, etc.
- Target issues that matter with filters to drill down to details of specific time periods, folders, recipe status
- Manage and fix errors that need immediate attention
- Google like search using keywords across all job history data

#### Why is it useful
- Faster discovery and resolution of issues increases uptime & improves SLA
- Significant savings in time and effort in monitoring all recipes for an account
- Unprecedented access to audit, troubleshoot and resolve issues to improve data quality & integrity

#### Competitive Advantage
For other iPaaS vendors:

- Dashboards provide operational insights using technical data vis-a-vis CPU, memory and I/O utilization & performance, and aggregated job run stats - requiring users to manually analyze and discover issues.
- Accessing and querying job history data/logs when available would require custom tooling or 3rd party tools.
